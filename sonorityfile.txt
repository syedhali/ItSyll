[Segments]
# Before the syllabification happens,
# a transducer will convert the input into phonological
# objects. This section specifies the vocabulary to use for the
# translation, in the form X = z, w, y, where:
# X is the input form, the one to find in the string to syllabify
# z is the phonological segment, the one will be printed 
# w is the sonority used by the syllabification algorithm
# y is the phonological class (printed if output = cvg is chosen)
# You may add, remove or edit any segment to adapt it to 
# your alphabet or language. For example, if want to 
# add a central /i/ to the vowel inventory
# you will write something like:
# I = I, 22, V
